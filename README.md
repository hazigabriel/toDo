# toDo
Part of theOdinProject's "Javascript" curriculum.

This project is a toDo tracker, in which we can added different projects and within each project we can have multisple tasks.

The project names can be updated after being created and we have the option to delete them, along with the tasks contained. Tasks are dynamically rendered on the page after a new project is selected. Upon creating a task we have the option to edit all of its values, delete the task or mark it as completed. 

Taskk priority is reflected by the task border color, red being urgent, yellow being mid priority and light blue being low priority. 


Materialize CSS framework was used for styling and for the date picker, along with webpack to bundle the modules.
